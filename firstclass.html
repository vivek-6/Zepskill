<!-- <h1>CAT</h1>
<p>
  The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal.[1][2]
  It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and is commonly
  referred to as the domestic cat or house cat to distinguish it from the wild
  members of the family.[4] Cats are commonly kept as house pets but can also be
  farm cats or feral cats; the feral cat ranges freely and avoids human
  contact.[5] Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their
  ability to kill rodents. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat
  registries

<p>
  The cat is similar in anatomy to the other felid species: it has a strong
  flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth, and retractable claws adapted to
  killing small prey. Its night vision and sense of smell are well developed.
  Cat communication includes vocalizations like meowing, purring, trilling,
  hissing, growling, and grunting as well as cat-specific body language.
  Although the cat is a social species, it is a solitary hunter. As a predator,
  it is crepuscular, i.e. most active at dawn and dusk. It can hear sounds too
  faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and
  other small mammals.[7] It also secretes and perceives pheromones.[8] Female
  domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn, with litter sizes
  often ranging from two to five kittens.[9] Domestic cats are bred and shown at
  events as registered pedigreed cats, a hobby known as cat fancy. Population
  control of cats may be effected by spaying and neutering, but their
  proliferation and the abandonment of pets has resulted in large numbers of
  feral cats worldwide, contributing to the extinction of entire bird, mammal,
  and reptile species.

<h2>CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<h3>Size</h3>
<p>
  The domestic cat has a smaller skull and shorter bones than the European
  wildcat.[60] It averages about 46 cm (18 in) in head-to-body length and 23–25
  cm (9–10 in) in height, with about 30 cm (12 in) long tails. Males are larger
  than females.[61] Adult domestic cats typically weigh between 4 and 5 kg (9
  and 11 lb)

<h3>Skelton</h3>
<p>
  Cats have seven cervical vertebrae (as do most mammals); 13 thoracic vertebrae
  (humans have 12); seven lumbar vertebrae (humans have five); three sacral
  vertebrae (as do most mammals, but humans have five); and a variable number of
  caudal vertebrae in the tail (humans have only three to five vestigial caudal
  vertebrae, fused into an internal coccyx).[62]: 11  The extra lumbar and
  thoracic vertebrae account for the cat's spinal mobility and flexibility
</p>
<h3>Skull</h3>
<p>
  The cat skull is unusual among mammals in having very large eye sockets and a
  powerful specialized jaw.[64]: 35  Within the jaw, cats have teeth adapted for
  killing prey and tearing meat. When it overpowers its prey, a cat delivers a
  lethal neck bite with its two long canine teeth, inserting them between two of
  the prey's vertebrae and severing its spinal cord, causing irreversible
  paralysis and death.[65] Compared to other felines, domestic cats have
  narrowly spaced canine teeth relative to the size of their jaw, which is an
  adaptation to their preferred prey of small rodents, which have small
  vertebrae.
</p>
<p>
  The premolar and first molar together compose the carnassial pair on each side
  of the mouth, which efficiently shears meat into small pieces, like a pair of
  scissors. These are vital in feeding, since cats' small molars cannot chew
  food effectively, and cats are largely incapable of mastication.[64]: 37 
  Although cats tend to have better teeth than most humans, with decay generally
  less likely because of a thicker protective layer of enamel, a less damaging
  saliva, less retention of food particles between teeth, and a diet mostly
  devoid of sugar, they are nonetheless subject to occasional tooth loss and
  infection.
